            <strong>Smart Farm 360</strong> is an AI-driven smart farming platform designed to empower farmers with
            real-time insights, crop health monitoring, and precision farming tools. It transforms data from drones,
            soil sensors, and satellite imagery into actionable guidance.

            🌀 Overall Shape — The CircleRepresents 360° — the full-cycle approach to farming.Symbolizes wholeness,
            connected systems, and smart integration — crop to drone to soil to analytics. It's not just farming—it's
            Smart Farming All Around.

            represent crop fields, plants, or fertile land.It's the heart of farming, nurtured by tech.🧠
            Interpretation: "Tech must serve nature, not replace it."
          </p>
          <p>
            🟫 Brown Segment (Top-center-right)Brown = soil, earth, roots.This segment represents the foundation —
            literally, the ground-level of agriculture.Emphasizes soil quality, organic health, and possibly farm
            documentation like land ownership or location data.🧠 Hidden message: "Know your soil, know your farm."
          </p>
          <p>
            🔵 Blue Segments (Bottom-left, Bottom-right & Top-right)Blue = water, sky, technology, and innovation.This
            can represent:💧 Irrigation & water conservation☁️ Cloud-based AI systems🚁 Drone monitoringBlue in the top
            also may hint at the drone controller part of your system flying over the farm.🧠 Insight: Farming isn't
            grounded anymore. It's flying.
          </p>
          <p>
            🌿 Central Plant Inside the CircleThe green plant in the middle is the core focus: growing crops.It's
            sprouting from a geometric base that splits downward — almost looks like roots meeting tech.The surrounding
            shapes subtly mimic leaves, fields, and data flow.🧠 Message: "Every leaf is connected. Every crop is
            tracked. Every byte counts."
